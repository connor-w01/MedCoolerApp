# MedCoolerApp
The app and microcontroller code for the MedCooler capstone project

The ability to safely transport temperature-sensitive medications remains a challenge for individuals requiring long term access to them. 
The current market options are prohibitively expensive and must be manually monitored and controlled by the consumer. 
This project presents the design and development of MedCooler, a low-cost electronically controlled and monitorable portable medicine cooler capable of maintaining a stable temperature range for extended durations with a rechargeable battery. 
This system integrates a Peltier module, a microcontroller, and an insulated container to regulate the internal temperature while allowing remote access via a Bluetooth android application. 
The MedCooler is designed to provide a more affordable, remotely monitorable transportation method for medications during travel where access to refrigerators is limited. 
The MedCooler weighs less than 10lbs, has a volume of 450 in3, and has an adjustable strap for increased portability.
It is capable of remote communication via Bluetooth to an Android application up to 150ft away. 
One MedCooler costs roughly $175 and is able to maintain an internal temperature between 36° and 46° Fahrenheit for up to 24 hours using a Peltier cooling system powered by a single battery charge. 

This repository contains the andoird application code as well as the microcontroller logic powering the on device Microcontroller.
